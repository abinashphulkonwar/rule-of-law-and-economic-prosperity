## Experimental Equation: Rule of Law & Economic Prosperity

\[
\ln(\text{percapita}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{RuleOfLaw} + \varepsilon
\]

Where:

- \(\ln(\text{percapita})\) = Natural logarithm of GDP per capita (dependent variable).
- \(\beta_0\) = Intercept term.
- \(\beta_1\) = Coefficient of **Rule of Law** (independent variable).
- \(\varepsilon\) = Error term (captures unobserved factors).

### Interpretation:

- If **\(\beta_1 > 0\)** â†’ Stronger rule of law is associated with higher economic prosperity.
- If **\(\beta_1 < 0\)** â†’ Rule of law negatively impacts economic prosperity.
- If **\(\beta_1\) is insignificant** â†’ No strong evidence of a relationship.

ðŸš€ _Future experiments will incorporate control variables (e.g., inequality, human capital) for deeper analysis._
