## Experimental Equation: Rule of Law & Economic Prosperity

```Math
ln(percapita) = Î²0 + Î²1 â‹… RuleOfLaw + Îµ
```

Where:

- `ln(percapita)` = Natural logarithm of GDP per capita (dependent variable).
- `Î²0` = Intercept term.
- `Î²1` = Coefficient of **Rule of Law** (independent variable).
- `Îµ` = Error term (captures unobserved factors).

### Interpretation:

- If **Î²1 > 0** â†’ Stronger rule of law is associated with higher economic prosperity.
- If **Î²1 < 0** â†’ Rule of law negatively impacts economic prosperity.
- If **Î²1 is insignificant** â†’ No strong evidence of a relationship.

ðŸš€ _Future experiments will incorporate control variables (e.g., inequality, human capital) for deeper analysis._
